# AIME-Answer-Checker

This is a tool for checking answers for the AIME competition, a high-school math competition. Generally, places to check answers always give you the answer instead of telling you if it is right or wrong, and let you continue solving the problem. This is what this tool aims to accomplish - it tells you whether you are right or wrong.
